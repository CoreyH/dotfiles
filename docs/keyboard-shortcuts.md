## Customization

```

```

   - Hold + other key: Triggers shortcuts

2. **Virtual Desktops** (Workspaces):
   - Super+Page Up/Down: Switch workspaces
   - Super+Shift+Page Up/Down: Move window to workspace

3. **Quick App Switching**:
   - Alt+Tab: Switch windows (shows all windows)
   - Super+Tab: Switch apps (groups by application)

4. **Terminal Shortcuts**:
   - Ctrl+Shift+C: Copy in terminal
   - Ctrl+Shift+V: Paste in terminal
   - Ctrl+Shift+T: New terminal tab

## Troubleshooting
